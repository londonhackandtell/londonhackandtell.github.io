Good morning London Hackers!

Hope y'all are having a great weekend â€“ this is the big reveal we were all waiting for.

We're meeting on Tuesday at Campus London, 4-5 Bonhill Street. Pizza will arrive at 6.30pm and we'll start the talks at 7pm.

I'll greet you at the door and take you downstairs to the cafeteria, where the fun begins!
