Despite doubling and then tripling our efforts, we were unable to get any speakers this month. It seems that people are REALLY busy with deadlines and upcoming holidays ;-)

Soooo instead of the usual meetup and talks, we'll just gather at Spaces London 6.30-7pm and head over to the pub (the Fox?).

Your local co-organizers,
