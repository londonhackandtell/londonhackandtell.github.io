Good evening London Hackers!

This is Jan Domanski, your local organizer, and I'm *thrilled* to be sending out this announcement. To quote the Bender Bending Rodríguez "we're back baby"!

For this most spectacular return, we have a small but exciting line-up for you.

Also, we really wanna hear about *your* hacks – it can be hardware, software, finance, government, fashion. You name it, we game it!

Talk time is 5 min so entry-level hacks can be presented too!

Our wonderful sponsors, Entrepreneur First, were generous enough to offer their space and will bank-roll the pizza and drinks.

The food will arrive at 6.30pm and we'll start the talks shortly afterwards.

Besto pesto,

- Janski
