Good morning London Hackers!

It's time to reveal this week's hacks! Bit later than usual but better late than never ;-)

We'll meet later today, at Campus London, 4-5 Bonhill Street. We'll start gathering at 6.30pm, and the talks will start at 7pm. After the talks, we'll head over to a nearby pub to chat away.

I'll greet you at the door and take you downstairs to the cafeteria, where the fun begins!

Here are the hacks!

Full disclosure: unfortunately, our sponsors have pulled out and there will be no pizza this week. I'm super-sorry and will do my best to secure sponsorship for December's meetup.

We thank our our sponsors Campus London for hosting the event [@CampusLondon](https://twitter.com/CampusLondon)

Best wishes,

- Janski, your local organizer
