Good morning London Hackers!

Welcome back to Monday â€“ it's time to reveal this week's hacks.

We'll meet tomorrow, on Tuesday at Campus London, 4-5 Bonhill Street. We'll start gathering at 6.30pm, and start the talks at 7pm. After the talks, we'll head over to a nearby pub to chat away.

I'll greet you at the door and take you downstairs to the cafeteria, where the fun begins!

Here are the hacks!
- "Cast/Away: Defeating AP Isolation and Captive Portal WiFi Networks" by Andy Kwong
- "Teaching a robot to type" by Isaac from Automata
- "Terraforming 101: baby steps on your personal page" by [@jandom_random](https://twitter.com/jandom_random)
- Gaetano Checinski (tentative)
- Reaal Khalil (tentative)

Full disclosure: unfortunately, our sponsors have pulled out and there will be no pizza this week. I'm super-sorry and will do my best to secure sponsorship for December's meetup.

We thank our our sponsors Campus London for hosting the event [@CampusLondon](https://twitter.com/CampusLondon)

Best wishes,

- Janski, your local organizer
