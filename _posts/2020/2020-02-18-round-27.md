**New venue tomorrow** we're back in Bermondsey!
Directions if you’re coming from Bermondsey Station: Turn right out of Bermondsey station and take the second right onto Drummond Road. Follow down Drummond Road, past Clements Road. The first right after Clements Road is the parking lot of our building (there will be a few upright poles as blockers into the road and might be a red and white plastic barrier). We’re in the office on that corner, on the second floor up. Come down the road/parking lot for the building entrance and enter 213 into the panel and come up to the second floor!
