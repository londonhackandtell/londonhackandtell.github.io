We wanted to thank Automata for sponsoring the meetup for the last six months.
Unfortunately, the sponsorship is getting suspended.
We're really grateful to Automata for extending their hospitality for so long, so please thank them when you swing by.
Now, we're looking for a new home, so if you know a company or an event space who's willing to sponsor, please pleas please get in touch :-)

Best wishes,
Janski and Hussky
