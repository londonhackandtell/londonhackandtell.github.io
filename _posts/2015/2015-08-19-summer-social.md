We all know Summer is a busy time with holidays scattered around. So this month, we want to spend some time getting to know each of you and letting you all hang out together.

Sooo lets do drinks!

Plan is to come along to BurgerBar - the newest and strangest bar in actually on Old Street Roundabout and hang out, have a chat.

Feel free to bring your laptops to show any recent hacks to one another!

Please note attendee numbers are not set in stone - we needed to give a rough figure to the bar itself!
