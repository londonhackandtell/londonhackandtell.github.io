Join us for our July meetup and show us what you've been working on. In the spirit of British Summertime we'll be chatting, watching and demoing over a cold Pimms, strawberries + usual offering of pizza and beer. After the demos we'll move round the corner to the garden at The Woolpack on Bermondsey St to make the most of the light evening.

*NEW* Reserve a demo slot: As the meetups become more popular we thought we've opened up some of the demo slots for you to pre-reserve. Tell us what you want to show here [https://goo.gl/RKsBik](https://goo.gl/RKsBik). Remember no hack is too small to show off!

A recap of the format:
Five-minute demos on something you're working on, or something you've done in the past. Anything is fair-game: web/desktop/mobile apps, hardware, libraries, visualisation etc (except for deckware - we want real demos of working, or partially-working, projects).

You do not have to demo - feel free to just show up and watch others demo. (Though if you have a friend or co-worker who is doing something cool, please pass the word on.)

The meetup is super relaxed and informal, there are not many rules, but:

* You'll get 5 minutes to present

* You or your team should have built it yourself

* People will ask questions in Q&A afterwards

* No pure slidedecks, no idea/startup pitches, only demos + code

* Keep in mind that the audience is highly technical, so show us code! (reasonable exemptions may be possible).

* Entertain us :) Door open 6.30PM. Demos start 7PM.

* No recruiters - if someone suspects you are attending just to recruit developers you will be kindly asked to leave.
