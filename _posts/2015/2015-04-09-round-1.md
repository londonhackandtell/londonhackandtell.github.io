Let's get together for our first London Hack & Tell meetup!

We need volunteers to give five-minute demos on something you're working on, or something you've done. Anything is fair-game: web/desktop/mobile apps, hardware, libraries, visualisation etc (except for deckware - we want real demos of working, or partially-working, projects).

You do not have to demo - feel free to just show up and watch others demo. (Though if you have a friend or co-worker who is doing something cool, please pass the word on.)

The meetup is super relaxed and informal, there are not many rules, but:

* You'll get 5 minutes to present
* You or your team should have built it yourself
* People will ask questions in Q&A afterwards
* No pure slidedecks, no idea/startup pitches, only demos + code
* Keep in mind that the audience is highly technical, so show us code! (reasonable exemptions may be possible).
* Entertain us :)

Door open 6.30PM. Demos start 7PM. Beer + Pizza galore.
