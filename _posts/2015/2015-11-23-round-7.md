Join us for November celebrations at Google Campus!

Submit a talk here. [https://hackandtell.typeform.com/to/HSi8Rh](https://hackandtell.typeform.com/to/HSi8Rh)

A recap of the format:

Five-minute demos on something you're working on, or something you've done in the past. Anything is fair-game: web/desktop/mobile apps, hardware, libraries, visualisation etc (except for deckware - we want real demos of working, or partially-working, projects).

You do not have to demo - feel free to just show up and watch others demo. (Though if you have a friend or co-worker who is doing something cool, please pass the word on.)

The meetup is super relaxed and informal, there are not many rules, but:

* You'll get 5 minutes to present, then 5mins Q&A. Feel free to submit you talk here [https://hackandtell.typeform.com/to/HSi8Rh](https://hackandtell.typeform.com/to/HSi8Rh).

* You or your team should have built it yourself

* No pure slidedecks, no idea/startup pitches, only demos + code

* Entertain us :) Doors and Demos start 7PM

* No recruiters - if someone suspects you are attending just to recruit developers you will be kindly asked to leave

* Check out our new CoC on [http://hackandtell.org/](http://hackandtell.org/)
