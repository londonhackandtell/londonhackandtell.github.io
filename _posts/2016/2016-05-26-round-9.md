** Based in Building L **

Doors at 6.30 PM. Talks start at 7 PM.

It's the end of the month, so let's see what you have been hacking on during May. Anything hack related is fair game (we'll know it when we see it): working, not working, demos, and stories.

If it's sunny we can eat and chat out on the balcony.

The meetup is super relaxed and informal. Rules:

* Entertain us :)

* Eat the Pizza.

* Browse our Code of Conduct on http://hackandtell.org/](http://hackandtell.org/)[
