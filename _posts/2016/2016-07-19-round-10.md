It's the mid summer (who could tell), so let's see what you have been hacking on. Anything hack related is fair game (we'll know it when we see it): working, not working, demos, and stories.

Five-minute demos on something you're working on. Anything is fair-game: web/desktop/mobile apps, hardware, libraries, visualisation etc.

The meetup is super relaxed and informal. Rules:

* You'll get 5 minutes to present, then 5mins Q&A. Feel free to submit you talk here (https://hackandtell.typeform.com/to/HSi8Rh).

* Entertain us :)

* Eat the Pizza.

* Browse our Code of Conduct on (http://hackandtell.org/)[http://hackandtell.org/]

See you there!
