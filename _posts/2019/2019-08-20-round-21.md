Good afternoon London Hackers,

We’re hyped for another round of hacks on Tuesday the 20th August. Once again we’re getting together at the Automata HQ near Angel.

Here are the glorious speakers that will amuse you tomorrow:
- "A pocket blochain data logger for logistics industry" by Arthur Goujon
- "How using Twitter and having fun will help you make friends and take over the world. " by Simranjeet Riyat from Social Impact Capital [@simriyat](https://twitter.com/simriyat)
- "Burnout avoidance techniques" by Jan Domanski, CTO at Labstep [@jandom_random](https://twitter.com/jandom_random)

There’s still room for one or two more talks – make sure you get in quick. [Sign up here and impress everyone with your hack](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93).

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat!

Best wishes,
Janski, Hussky and Xan
