Good afternoon hackies and tellies,

Hope y'all are having a great weekend â€“ this is the big reveal we were all waiting for.

We're meeting this Tuesday at Spaces City Road, Epworth House, 25 City Rd. We'll start gathering at 6.30pm and we'll start the talks at 7pm. Afterwards, there will be the new tradition of a pub visit.

Here are the amazing talks we'll have for you this week!

- "Git as a DownloadManager - How the f*** do I download #deadbeef?" by Gaetano Checinski, CEO at LoopPerfect
- "breaking, then un-breaking, then re-breaking the internet" by the one and only Huss [@HUSSTECH](https://twitter.com/HUSSTECH) CTO of 9fin
- Xan O'Shea will present a mysterious hardware hack
- "Story of a 1-liner contribution to the PHP ecosystem in 2019" by Jan [@jandom_random](https://twitter.com/jandom_random) CTO of Labstep

Many thanks to Spaces for letting us use their space free of charge; additionally thanks to Google for sharing their projector screen rig.

Best wishes,

- Janski & Huss
Your local co-organizers
