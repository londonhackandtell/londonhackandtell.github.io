Good afternoon hackies and tellies,

The weekend is nearly upon us, we did it again!

We're meeting on Tuesday at the new venue: Automata HQ, Holford St, Bevin Way, Islington, London WC1X 9HD

We'll start gathering a bit earlier, at 6pm and we'll start the talks at 6.30pm.
Afterwards, heading to a nearby pub to mingle with your fellow hackers.

Some new speakers were added since the last email. Here are the spectaculars hacks we have for you:
- "Zen and Servo Motors" by Xan O'Shea [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Aj9XSO_qNqKngLEmxaHJR110zo4GLIxe)
- "Who Puppeteers the Puppeteer - A story about Scraping with Proxies, Tor and Botnets" by Gaetano Checinski, CEO at LoopPerfect [cancelled]
- "Time Warp: Trick yourself into doing stuff with science!" by our own Huss [@HUSSTECH](https://twitter.com/HUSSTECH) CTO of 9fin
- "How to make physical objects Morph?" by Antoni Pakowski
- "Elasticbeanstalk - a brief look under the cover, basics of scale on AWS" by Jan Domanski [@jandom_random](https://twitter.com/jandom_random) CTO of Labstep [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MoexJkV2cvoMR12TnvY-fy0TFCiot7f3) [github](https://github.com/jandom/elastic-beanstalk-101)
- A mysterious talk on robotics from the member of Automata team
- "Making designing complicated things really easy for non- mechanical engineers" by Pari Singh [@parikshat7](https://twitter.com/parikshat7) CEO of the Engineering Company

6 talks in total – amazing! can't wait to see what the speakers have prepared!

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors:

We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat!

Many thanks,

- Janski & Huss
