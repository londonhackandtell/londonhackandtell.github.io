BERMONDSEY RETURNS Round 27: The Whisky Fairies

Body:
Good evening **Hackies and Tellies**!

A couple of big announcements: we have a new sponsor AND a new venue.
It's back to Bermondsey, where it all started! Ground zero for London Hack'n'Tell.
We should be set for another 3 months while we continue to figure things out.

Please give a round of applause to Peter Chen of JP Morgan who will be the sponsor for the pizza.

Equally big claps for The Engineering Company, who have allowed us to host at their office. Here is a quote from Pari, their CEO
*We're building technologies to democraitese the design of complex hardware (kids can design rocket engines, robotics and UAVs in hours)*
