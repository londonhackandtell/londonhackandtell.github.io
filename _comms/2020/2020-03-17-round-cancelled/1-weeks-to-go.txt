Subject:
Cancelled: NEXT TUESDAY Round

Body:
Hi there Team Hack&&Tell,

We’re really sorry to cancel the event next Tuesday.
Many people have already been told to work from home due to the corona virus outbreak.
We don’t think it’ll be safe or fun to encourage you guys to attend.
Meanwhile, don’t keep those beautiful and creative minds of your working!
Got a Coronavirus hack, maybe something about remote working? Keep it and share it with us in April (hopefully!)

Best wishes,

Janski, Hussky & Alessio
Your local co-organisers
