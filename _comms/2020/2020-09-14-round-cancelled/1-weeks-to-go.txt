Subject:
The Return of the Hackers

Body:
Hello hello Hack&&Tell,

How have you all been? We've had quite a year! Just a moment ago, I looked at the last email sent cancelling the meetup in March. What a year we've had! Our sincere best wishes to all of you affected by this outbreak. We know many of you, your friends and families have suffered during those months. 

Having said that, we are a community that looks bravely into the future. We adapt, improvise and get creative – this is what we do best. That's why we want to bring everyone back together – what have you been up to? What crazy projects you've got on your platter?

The format will be different, we'll gather remotely – you can participate and see the hacks without the pesky commute, without even being in London or the UK! We know that you've kept your beautiful minds creative during this time and want to see what you've been up to! We don't have a date yet but we always want your hacks – the [signup sheet](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93) awaits :-) 

Best wishes,

Janski, Hussky & Alessio
Your local co-organizers
