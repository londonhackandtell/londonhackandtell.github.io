Subject:
RETURNING TOMORROW Round 26: Sea Horse With a Snapback

Body:
Good evening London Hackers,

We’re hyped for another round of hacks on tomorrow [RSVP link here](https://www.meetup.com/London-Hack-and-Tell/events/pgstfryzqbwb/).
Once again we’re getting together at the Automata HQ near Angel, free pizza and beer will be there too. Maybe a cheeky pub afterwards?

There’s still room for one or two more talks! It's only 5 minutes so really quick to put together [Sign up link for speakers](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93).

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat! [Take a look at our hiring priorities](https://automata.tech/careers/)*

Best wishes,

Janski and Hussky
