Subject:
THANK YOU and what comes next?

Body:
Good morning **Hackies and Tellies**,

Many thanks for coming to the 1st meetup in 2020! My particular thanks go to our wonderful speakers, who never fail to amuse.

In case you missed the event or want to refresh your memory:
- Meetup notes and speaker slides are up, see the [writeup](https://london.hackandtell.org/2020/01/21/round-26.html)
- Find yourself in the photos [here](https://www.meetup.com/London-Hack-and-Tell/photos/30694640/488388709/)

A massive shout out to our sponsors Automata Tech! They've been with us for over half a year and we see to see the journey end.

So we're looking for a new sponsor(s) and a new venue – and we need **your** help.
If you could reach out to your network and friends, ask them for help – reach out to us via meetup messages if you wanna give a hand.

Best wishes,

Janski, Huss and Xan
