London Hack&&Tell is a unique group where you can show-case your hacks and the little side-projects you've been working on!

Looking in particular for female speakers â€“ some of the best hacks we've seen have come from lady presenters!

Subject:
DEFINITELY HAPPENING: Round 13: Optimus Fourier

Body:
Good afternoon London Hackers!

Hope y'all enjoying the long weekend, doing whatever makes you happy or excited (for me, that means working on those amusing hacks)!

Big announcement in this email: our next meetup "Optimus Fourier" is Sept 13. Can't believe how much we've grown and that it's number 3. already!

We'll be heading out to a new venue (exciting!): this time it'll be 6.30pm in Google Campus. It's located between Moorgate and Old Street, in the heart of London startup hub.

It's all about the hacks â€“ and we want them, real, real bad. We want to hear about *your* hacks specifically, no matter if you're an expert speaker or a 1st timer. The signup here https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93

Many thanks to Google Campus for hosting and to Entrepreneur Firsts for their sponsorship!

Best pesto,
