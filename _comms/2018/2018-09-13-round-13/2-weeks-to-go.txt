Good afternoon London Hackies and Tellies!

It's only 11 days left until our next meetup, Round 13 the "Optimus Fourier"!

See you guys September 13. Thursday at 6.30pm at our new venue, the Google Campus.

We have fantastic speakers signed-up to talk about their hacks – but we could always use a few more. This means you! Sign-up to speak at https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93
