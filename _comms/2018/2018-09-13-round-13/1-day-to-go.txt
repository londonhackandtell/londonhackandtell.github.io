Good morning London Hackers!

See you all tonight for a series of thrilling hacks!

Please keep in mind the venue change: we're meeting at Campus London, 4-5 Bonhill Street. Don't go to Bermondsey by mistake ;-)

Pizza will arrive at 6.30pm and we'll start the talks at 7pm. There is more security at Campus London â€“ I'll greet you at the door and take you downstairs to the cafeteria. We're still working on getting soft-drinks but we won't be able to bring in alcoholic drinks into Google Campus.

Here are the hacks!
- "How to come up with over 1000 content ideas in 15 minutes"
- "My English NLP-ised"
- "Orbs Game"
- "Semantic Analysis, Visualisation and transpilation of buildscripts"
- "Cracking the code... of the pizza promo code"

We thank our pizza sponsors, Entrepreneur First [@join_ef](https://twitter.com/join_ef)
As well as Campus London for hosting the event [@CampusLondon](https://twitter.com/CampusLondon)

Best wishes,

- Janski, your local organizer
