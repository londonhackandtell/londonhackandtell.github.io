### Meetup

Subject:
THANK YOU and next meetup

Body:
Good Evening Hackies and Tellies,

Thank you all for coming last night and being such an amazing audience. Many thanks to our delightful speakers, who amused us with their clever harks. Thank you to our timer and camera volunteers too :-)

Meetup notes from yesterday, slides, and links are available on our website

Yesterday we tried a bunch of new things. Some things worked really well – Jason lead our 1st post-meetup excursion to a nearby pub. This is something we want to do more! Other things worked less well – like me taking pictures and trying to make a live twitter thing happen. Enthusiasm (turns out) is not enough ;-)

Round #15 "V for Virtual Machine" is coming up next! Tue, November 13. is the date to mark in your calendars.

And we do want your hacks, please send us your talk title here https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93

Big thanks to our sponsors Entrepreneur First https://apply.joinef.com, and to CampusLondon for hosting!

Besto pesto,

- Janski, your local organizer
