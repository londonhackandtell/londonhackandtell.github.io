Automata Hack Open Invitation
As mentioned in the presentation on Tuesday - If people have ideas for hacks that they would like to use the robot for please get in contact with us.  We can work out times with the person doing the hack, whether thats in the evenings or on the weekend or otherwise.  Depending on the complexity of the hack, it would be good to get ideas in by Nov 30th so that there is at least 2 weeks to get things working before the next Hack&&Tell.  Send ideas to ih+hack@automata.tech.
