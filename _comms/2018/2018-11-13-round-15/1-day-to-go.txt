INCOMING: Round 15 "V for Virtual Machine"

Body:
Good morning London Hackers!

Hope you are having a great weekend â€“ this is the big reveal we were all waiting for.

We're meeting on Tuesday at Campus London, 4-5 Bonhill Street.
We'll start gathering at 6.30pm and we'll start the talks at 7pm.
Soft-drinks will be provided but we're scrambling to find a sponsor for the pizza.

We'll greet you at the door and take you downstairs to the cafeteria, where the fun begins!

Many thanks to Campus London for hosting the event [@CampusLondon](https://twitter.com/CampusLondon)

Best wishes,

- Janski, your local organizer
