COMING SOON: Round 15 "V for Virtual Machine"

Body:
Good afternoon London Hackies and Tellies! Good weekend so far?

Our next meetup is coming up soon! In 2 weeks time, we'll be gathering again for Round 15 the "V for Virtual Machine". How thrilling!

The time is Tuesday, 13. November, 6.30pm at the Google Campus cafeteria (right and downstairs from the main lobby area).

We've got an extraordinary line-up this week, but we could always use a few more speakers. This means you! Sign-up to speak at https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93

Many thanks to our sponsors, Entrepreneur First (https://twitter.com/join_ef) and to our hosts Campus London (https://twitter.com/CampusLondon).

Best pesto,
