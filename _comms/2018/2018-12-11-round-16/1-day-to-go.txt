Body:
Good morning London Hackers!

Hope you had a great weekend. We're meeting on Tuesday at Spaces â€“ London, City Road. The exact address is

Epworth House, 25 City Rd, London EC1Y 1AA

This is because of construction work in the Google Campus and Spaces will be a temporary venue for Dec and January meetups.

We'll start gathering at 6.30pm, there will be soft-drinks, and we'll start the talks at 7pm.

Best wishes,

Your local co-organizers
- Janski and Hussky
