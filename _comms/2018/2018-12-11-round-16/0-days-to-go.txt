### Meetup

Subject:
PUB ONLY: Round 16 "Santa Vs Panda"

Body:
Good morning London Hackers!

Despite doubling and then tripling our efforts, we were unable to get any speakers this month. It seems that people are REALLY busy with deadlines and upcoming holidays ;-)

Soooo instead of the usual, we'll just gather at Spaces London 6.30-7pm and head over to the pub (the Fox?) afterward.

Your local co-organizers,
- Janski and Huss
