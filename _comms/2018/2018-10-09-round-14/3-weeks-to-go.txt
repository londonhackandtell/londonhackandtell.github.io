Thank you for attending the last meetup, we had a ton of fun last week! :-) However, time moves on fast and we're happy to announce our next meetup

We'll be meeting again, Tuesday 9th October for the "Vacumm Cleaner of Destiny" at the Google Campus, near the Moorgate and Old Street stations.

It's all about the hacks â€“ and we want them, real, real bad. We want to hear about *your* hacks specifically. The signup here https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93
