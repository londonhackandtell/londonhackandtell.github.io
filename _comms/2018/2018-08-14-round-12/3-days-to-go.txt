COUNTDOWN till Tuesday Round #12

Body:
Good morning London Hackers!

Hope y'all having a great weekend. Three more day, only three and you'll find out all that you wanted to know about the hacks... but were afraid to ask.

Our upcoming meetup is this Tue, on Aug 14th, in Enterpreneur First HQ. Minor venue change from Block M to Block L but it's all the same place really. The food will arrive at 6.30pm and we'll start the talks 20-30 min after that.

We already have SEVEN awesome hacks signed up. Come this Tuesday to hear about
- Dating 3.0 : Acquisition, Activation, Retention
- ML meets tricky dice
- Maker of an optimised playlist of youtube TED talks, based on your input preferences etc
- Breaking Bad PDFs
- Billions And Billions... of SQL inserts
- Shoreditch Flat White Index
- Fool me once, fool me twice, get me a lobbyist

Best pesto,

London Hack && Tell Team
