hi everyone!

London Hack and Tell returns on Tuesday, 17th September. It’s an “open mic night for tech” and you can see a variety of stunning speakers. Gardening, robotics, software, hardware – you name it we game it!

It’s 5 minutes talk, 5 minutes audience questions (per speaker) so really fun and fast paced! Did we mention free pizza and beer?

Body:
Good morning London Hackers,

We’re hyped for another round of hacks on Tuesday the 17th September. Once again we’re getting together at the Automata HQ near Angel.

The thrill-packed list of speakers will be sent over the weekend.

There’s still room for one or two more talks – make sure you get in quick. [Sign up here and impress everyone with your hack](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93).

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. Check it out at [https://automata.tech/](https://automata.tech/)*
Best wishes,

Janski, Hussky and Xan
Your local co-organisers
