BACK TO BUSINESS with Round 22: A Tale of Two Cities

Body:
Good evening **Hackies and Tellies**!

To start on a cheery note: Saturday is over, and Sunday is nearly over... and Monday is approaching.
But despair we shall not because a new hack'n'tell is closing in soon.
In just under 2 weeks time, on Tuesday 17. September, we'll be meeting for Round 22 "A Tale of Two Cities".

Come over if you're hungry for the latest and greatest in London robotics, gardening and hacking.
We take hacks from all ways of life: you don't need to be an expert, you don't need to be a ninja, you just need to be keen (preferably, keen as mustard).

The venue for the event is the Automata HQ, here is a short message from our sponsors:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. Check it out at [https://automata.tech/](https://automata.tech/)*

Besto pesto,

Janski, Huss and Xan
Your local co-organizers
