SEVEN DAYS AND COUNTING: Round 19 "The Lizard's Tail"

Body:
Good afternoon London Hackers!

Super excited to see you all next week for another portion of hacks! We'll gather on June 18. Tuesday, at 6pm, in the Automata HQ in Islington.

We'll be announcing the speaker list over the weekend, we've got some high flyers for you. Robotics and software are our bread and butter but we'll have some surprises too.

There is still room for 1-2 talks – so apply and boldly go! Signup to speak [sign-up form](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93)

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat!

Best wishes,

Janski, Hussky and Xan
Your local co-organizers
