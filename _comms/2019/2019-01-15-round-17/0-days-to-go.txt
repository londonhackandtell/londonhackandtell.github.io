TODAY: Round 17 "Monoids of Madness"

Body:
Good morning London Hackers!

See you later today, at 6.30pm in Spaces City Road for your monthly fix of hacks, tweaks and other goodies.

The talks will start at 7pm and after we're amused by our speakers, we'll head over to a pub next doors for food and dirkns.

Many thanks to Spaces for letting us use their space free of charge; additionally thanks to Google for sharing their projector screen rig.

Best wishes,

- Janski & Huss
