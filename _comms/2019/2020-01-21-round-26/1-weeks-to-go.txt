NEXT TUESDAY Round 26: Sea Horse With a Snapback

Body:
Good morning London Hackers,

Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters!
The moment we've been all waiting for is approaching rapidly: another round of hacks on Tuesday 21 January.
Once again weâ€™re getting together at the Automata HQ near Angel.

- Do you have some useful hacks you wanna share with others? [Sign up here and impress everyone with your hack](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93).

- Do you just wanna come along, see what other folks are up to? (Have free pizza and beer?) [RVSP](https://www.meetup.com/London-Hack-and-Tell/events/pgstfrybccbcc/)

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. Check it out at [https://automata.tech/](https://automata.tech/)*

Best wishes,

Janski and Hussky
Your local co-organisers
