Subject:
NEXT TUESDAY Round 24: Boulevard of Broken Symmetry

Body:
Good evening London Hackers,

Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters... comrades?
The moment we've been all waiting for is approaching rapidly: another round of hacks on Tuesday 19th November.
Once again weâ€™re getting together at the Automata HQ near Angel.

Do you have some useful hacks you wanna share with others? [Sign up here and impress everyone with your hack](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93).

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. Check it out at [https://automata.tech/](https://automata.tech/)*
Best wishes,

Janski, Hussky and Xan
Your local co-organisers
