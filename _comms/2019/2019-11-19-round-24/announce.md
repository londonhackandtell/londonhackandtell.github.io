Good evening Hackers and Tellers alike,

Fresh off our largest meetup yet, the time has come to announce our November meetup!

Ahhh November...is it winter, is it still autumn? A confusing month for us all, so why not come down to Hack&&Tell London Round 24: Boulevard of broken symmetry, where many of life's big questions are pondered. Or just come by for the wild presentations, food and drinks. Bring a friend or 10. See you on November 19th 2019, [here](https://www.meetup.com/London-Hack-and-Tell/events/pgstfryzpbzb/), within easy reach from the Angel or King's Cross area.

Speakers please start your engines! Signup form: https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93

We've had many first time speakers in the last few months, hope to see some more. Do feel free to message us if you have any questions or want to bounce ideas off us...we're here to help :)

Fond memories of last month?

Once again a big thanks to everyone who came out last month. It was great to have a full house and fascinating talks.

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they’ve presented at the meetup:

We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat!

Best wishes,
Janski, Hussky and Xan
