Subject:
THE GLORIOUS RETURN: Round 18 "Dark Side of the Spoon"

Body:
Good morning Hackies and Tellies!

And what a perfect sunny morning it is! There is some beyond-exciting news we've got to spill: after some soul searching, wandering around in the desert we've teamed up with Automata as our new sponsor.

This is still in the experimental phase so we'll need all the help from you to spread the word about the event, to your friends, colleagues and family members... bring even the stranger on the street.

Here is a short message from Automata, you may remember some of the hacks they've presented in the past:

We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat! (Take a look at our hiring priorities [here](https://automata.tech/careers/))

Our next meetup is coming up soon! In just under 2 weeks time, we'll be gathering again for Round 18 the "Dark Side of the Spoon".

The time is Tuesday, 14. May, 6.00pm at the Automata HQ by Angel **note the new venue**

We're looking forward to hearing about what you've been up! Sign-up to speak at ﻿https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93

Wishing you all a great bank holiday weekend too – hope y'all get a nice good rest!

Best pesto,
