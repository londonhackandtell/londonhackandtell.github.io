Good evening Hackies and Tellies,

Well done everyone, we did it again and what a meetup it was! Massive thanks to all who attended and to our amazing speakers for showing off their hacks!

Stay tuned for the next meetup: spread the word to your friends and colleagues. We want your hacks – signup to speak [here](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93)

Lastly, a massive shout out to our sponsors Automata

We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat! (Take a look at our hiring priorities [here](https://automata.tech/careers/))

Besto pesto,

- Janski, Huss and Alexander
Your local co-organizers
