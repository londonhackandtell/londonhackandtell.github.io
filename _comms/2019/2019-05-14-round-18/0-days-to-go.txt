TOMORROW: Tuesday Round 18 "Dark Side of the Spoon"

Body:
Good evening London Hackers!

We're super excited for our great reboot - see y'all tomorrow at 6pm tomorrow Automata HQ!

There will be beer and pizza, along with your monthly fix of hacks, tweaks and other goodies.

The talks will start at 6.30pm and after we're amused by our speakers, we'll head over to a pub next doors.

Many thanks to Automata for helping us through their sponsorship, here is a short message from them:

We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat! (Take a look at our hiring priorities [here](https://automata.tech/careers/))


Best wishes,
