Your favorite tech meetup returns! In just 7 days, on 14. May, the London Hack’n’Tell we’ll provide you with a hack-filled feast (many presenters are Seedcamp portfolio founders). The venue is the Automata Tech HQ in Angel, 6pm start with pizza and drinks. Share with friends, co-workers, flatmates!

Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack! The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you’d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat!
