WEEKEND'O HACK 25: Reindeer Relay

Body:
Good afternoon **Hackies and Tellies**!

What a year it has been! Are you ready for another round of hacks on Tuesday the 17th December?
Once again we’re getting together at the Automata HQ near Angel.

We're looking for fill our speaker roster, still got a slot or two open that has YOUR name on it. It's way easier than you imagine and this month will be the one that you decide "I'm going to give that a go..."
[Fill in the form here](https://goo.gl/forms/34zs7dEoOetKNJe93)

Looking for an idea on what to present? It can be something silly, not just industry-grade.
For example, I'll amuse you with a story of how I bought a stupid tablet for $300 in 2012 and brought it back to life in 2019.

Join us for for hacks, free pizza and beer and pub afterwards! [RSVP here](https://www.meetup.com/London-Hack-and-Tell/events/pgstfryzqbwb/)

Here is a short message from Automata, our fantastic sponsors. You may remember some of the hacks they've presented at the meetup:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat!
