Subject:
THANK YOU and next round

Body:
Good evening **Hackies and Tellies**,

Many thanks for coming to the last event of 2019! What an epic year that was with so many memorable speakers. Maybe we should do a cute mini-poll to see which hacks were the most popular? Nah, no need – everybody knows it's the cucumber growing that won our hearts and minds.

My particular thanks go to our wonderful speakers, who never fail to amuse, and our sponsors who never fail to provide us with shelter.

But my personal thanks go to **Peter**, a fresh Hack'n'Teller who said he's been reading these emails for months before attending (and enjoying it). Let's all be like Peter in 2020, and have the courage (and make time) to do all those things that interest us.

In case you missed the event or want to refresh your memory:
- Meetup notes and speaker slides are up, see the [writeup](https://london.hackandtell.org/2019/12/17/round-25.html)

A massive shout out to our sponsors Automata Tech! Here is a quick message from these great guys:

*We make a robot called Eva - something that would never have been possible without mechanical hacks, electronic hacks and software hacks. We’re really looking forward to hosting all this devious brainpower in our kitchen - not in the least because we’ll definitely be trying to snatch some of you up to come and work with us. So if you’re hungry for wildly difficult problems to solve in electronics design, PHP, Javascript, C++ or Go, make sure you grab one of us for a chat! (Take a look at our hiring priorities [here](https://automata.tech/careers/))*

Best wishes,

Janski, Huss and Xan
